# CS-350-Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
One project that was completed for this class was a microcontroller driver that caused the board to flash in Morse code sequences using a red and a green LED.

What did you do particularly well?
One thing that I did particularly well was simplifying the transitions of the state machine that was used as the heart of the program. This simplification was achieved by using character arrays to hold the sequences and a function to iterate through the sequences in order to determine the transitions.

Where could you improve?
I could improve the amount of time it takes me to complete a project.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The ability to begin to work with embedded systems is a tool that I will most likely be using again in my career.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Creating and implementing state machines is a particularly transferable skill that I have learned from the coursework.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Using functions to reduce repetitive code, and separating distinct code into separate classes was the primary method for keeping the code adaptable. The code was made readable by including in-line comments and the addition of appropriate white space.
